1. In order to reduce code duplication, describe how you would handle code that is shared among multiple test
classes and methods.

- I would use the JAVA OOPS concept, more specifically the inheritance in order to reuse the methods and avoid the duplication of the code.





2. How would you handle selecting the desired option in a drop-down element that is not a normal HTML select
element?

- I would consider it as any normal WebElement, inspect it and use FindElement and then click on it.




3. Given the two tables below (Account and Customer),
Write a query that will return the first and last names of accounts that are ACTIVE and with a balance of less
than 2,000

-SELECT FIRST NAME, LAST NAME
 FROM Customer
 INNER JOIN Account
 ON  Customer.CARD NUMBER = Account.CARD_NUM
 WHERE  Account.STATUS = 'ACTIVE' AND Account.BALANCE < 2000;





 4. Coding task :

 -The website works perfectly fine through the manual test. Although, the automation test does not

 perform as expected because by clicking on either "Continue" or "Skip the step" it directs you to an error page

 and not to the needed page to perform assertion.

 The website seems to be set to a high security layer since it is banking related as you are aware of.
